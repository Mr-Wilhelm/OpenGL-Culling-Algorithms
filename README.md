How to Use:

All actions should only be done in Main.cpp.
In the int main() function, there is a section which looks like:

    //----------SELECT ENVIRONMENT HERE----------
    //------CHOICES: DENSE, SPARSE, DYNAMIC------

    //chosenEnvironment = DENSE;
    chosenEnvironment = SPARSE;
    //chosenEnvironment = DYNAMIC;
    //chosenEnvironment = DEFAULT;

    //-------------------------------------------

Here you can change the environment before runtime.

During Runtime:
- WASD keys to move
- 1 - enable back face culling
- 2 - disable back face culling
- 3 - enable frustum culling
- 4 - disable frustum culling
- 5 - enable Z Culling
- 6 - disable Z Culling
